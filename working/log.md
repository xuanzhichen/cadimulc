## Late Nov

## Early and Mid-Nov

* Split the main task into two parts: building the test module and integrating the paper tutorial module.
* Find out the initial building logic: nonlinearMLC -> stage -> generator -> visualization -> regression and ind-test
* Expect to reuse the building logic for subsequent refactorings of the projects.

# Oct, 2023

* Refactor the code from the previous project and determine the goals: add maintenance tests and docs.
* Learn and refer to well-done github repositories (readability and maintaining) of the domain.
* Decide the Nonlinear-MLC initial repository architecture.
